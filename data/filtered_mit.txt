Postdoctoral associate Josh Borrow spoke with students from Watertown High School about his research and what inspired him to pursue a career in astrophysics. ‚ÄúOne of the things that comes with this job is this odd sense of scale,‚Äù said Borrow. ‚ÄúI think astronomers really understand scale better than many people do. And I think the most inspiring thing about that is just how small we are relative to the rest of the universe.‚Äù

According to Prof. Yossi Sheffi, increasing customer demand is the driving force behind the supply chain bottlenecks impacting the global delivery network. ‚ÄúThe smoking gun for consumer demand as the main culprit is that bottlenecks didn‚Äôt emerge as a significant hurdle until spring of 2021, says Sheffi‚Ä¶That was after the federal government has juiced spending by sending three rounds of stimulus checks to most households,‚Äù writes Paul Davidson for

reporter Jeremy Kahn spotlights a study co-authored by Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi exploring issues associated with ‚Äúexplainable‚Äù AI systems that are being applied in fields such as healthcare, finance and government. The researchers explain that those using such systems ‚Äúmight have misunderstood the capabilities of contemporary explainability techniques‚Äîthey can produce broad descriptions of how the AI system works in a general sense but, for individual decisions, the explanations are unreliable or, in some instances, only offer superficial levels of explanation.‚Äù

The New Yorker
Prof. Emily Richmond Pollock speaks with Isaac Chotiner of

Chemical Engineering Professor Ariel Furst and her team of students and postdocs are setting new standards for global health equity, sustainability, and clean energy as they develop inexpensive technologies that can be deployed on site in non-ideal conditions.
By day, Aero/Astro grad student Evan Kramer works on a new concept for a space telescope. By night, he points his cameras at the sky to uncover the beauty of the cosmos.
The MIT Caving Club teaches students and campus community members the basics of vertical caving. They meet twice a month in the stairwells of MIT with the aim of taking their stairwell rappelling skills into actual caves.
Cleaning solar panels currently is estimated to use about 10 billion gallons of water per year ‚Äî enough to supply drinking water for up to 2 million people. A new cleaning method could remove dust on solar installations, improving overall efficiency, without using water.
A retired Major in the U.S. Air Force, MIT AeroAstro PhD student Andrea Henshall has used MIT's free open learning resources, OpenCourseWare (OCW) and MITx, throughout her career to excel throughout her academic studies.
